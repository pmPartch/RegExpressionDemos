RegExpressionDemos
==================

Demos from the Get and Clean Data class slides on week 4

I've reproduced all of the examples from the two videos (part I and II).

Along the way, I found some errors in some of the patterns (like the Bush debate pattern). I've corrected the pattern and provided several alternatives. 

I also think it is important to see exactly how the strings were matched, so I used sub() to replace the match with 'XXXX' and then display these strings so you can see what happened.

I've added some non-matching strings when approprate. It is good to see when the pattern does not match.
